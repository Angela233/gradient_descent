Stochastic Gradient Descent
====

This IPython notebook gives a tutorial for implementing gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent in Python. This work is based on the algorithm described by Andrew Ng in Stanford CS 229 course. See http://cs229.stanford.edu/ for more info.

If you don't have IPython installed and you want to see the code, I converted the notebook to HTML and uploaded to my website <a href="http://dtnewman.com/misc/stochastic_gradient_descent.html">here</a>.
